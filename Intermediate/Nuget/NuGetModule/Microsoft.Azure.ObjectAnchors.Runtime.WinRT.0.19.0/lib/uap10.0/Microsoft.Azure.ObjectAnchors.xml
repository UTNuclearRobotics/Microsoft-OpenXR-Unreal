        <member name="T:aoa_object_control_point_">
Defines a "control point" that maps a location in the Spatial Graph to the model coordinate which should be placed there. A control point's accuracy is biased to the Spatial Graph node it is anchored to, so when rendering content relative to the object, control points bound to static nodes that are near the user should be given greater weight.

        <member name="T:aoa_object_observation_mode_">
Specifies how the environment should be observed to detect objects. Ambient observation relies on information about the environment that has been gathered by the system automatically as the user uses the device. This can result in quicker detection initially since the environment may already be scanned. However it may also contain stale data which can lead to poorer quality results. It is also limited to a standard resolution and area determined by the system, rather than tailored to the model. Active observation creates a fresh scan of the environment that is optimized for the model being detected. This avoids any problems with stale data, but requires the user to take some time to scan the environment before the object can be detected. Observations will continue to be accumulated until the query object is disposed, so re-using a query for multiple detections may produce quicker results.
